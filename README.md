# Conversational Components A-I Frontend exam task

Please fork the repo and make a version in which user selects from options provided by the app rather than typing an answer in.
* There should be 1-4 options per bot reply.
* The options should appear in chat-window footer (in place of the input field and sumbit button).
* Options should be styled with [Material UI Chips](https://material-ui.com/components/chips/).
* The "conversation" should be endless.
* For chat window reference, please see its [repo](https://github.com/ConversationalComponents/chat-window).
